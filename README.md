# Cryptography Algorithms Implementation
Welcome to my Cryptography Algorithms Implementation repository. Here, you'll find implementations of various cryptographic algorithms that I've worked on during my data protection classes. These algorithms are fundamental in securing data transmission and ensuring privacy in digital communication.

# Algorithms included
1. Bernstein Algorithm
2. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
3. RSA Algorithm
4. Vigenere Cipher
5. Substitution Cipher

# Usage
Each algorithm is implemented in C++. You can explore the code and understand the working of these cryptographic techniques.
